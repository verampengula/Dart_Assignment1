Dart Shape Calculation Program
Objective:
This Dart program calculates the area of different shapes (Rectangle and Circle) using object-oriented principles such as inheritance, interfaces, and file handling.

Features:
Object-Oriented Model with Classes and Inheritance:

Includes a superclass Polygon and subclasses Rectangle and Circle that inherit properties and methods from Polygon.
Class Implementing an Interface:

Both Rectangle and Circle classes implement the Shape interface, providing an implementation for the calculateArea() method.
Method Overriding in Subclasses:

Demonstrates method overriding with calculateArea() in the Rectangle and Circle classes, providing specific area calculation logic for each shape.
Data Initialization from a File:

Reads data from a file (data.txt) to initialize instances of Rectangle and Circle with specific dimensions (length, width, radius).
Displaying Information and Using a Loop:

Displays information about the shapes and calculates their areas.
Includes a method in main() that demonstrates the use of a loop (for loop) for counting.
